# Build Plan Review Summary

**Date**: December 19, 2025  
**Project**: Maru AI Academy  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Feature Development

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Your build is in **excellent shape**. You've completed the equivalent of the first 3 weeks of the original Azure→GCP migration plan, but with a more practical architecture:

- ✅ **Frontend**: Modern Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Backend**: Next.js API routes (serverless)
- ✅ **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless, auto-scaling)
- ✅ **Deployment**: Vercel (automated CI/CD)
- ✅ **Auth**: NextAuth.js with database sessions
- ✅ **Content**: Module system with gating logic

**Recommendation**: Continue building features while keeping deployment options open. Focus on user value, not infrastructure migration.

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

### **Option A: Stay on Vercel** ⭐ (Recommended)

**Why?**
- Already working
- $0 cost (vs $40+ on GCP)
- Focus on features, not DevOps
- Deploy in seconds
- Perfect for your current scale

**When to reconsider?**
- Monthly active users > 10,000
- Revenue > $1,000/month
- Need GCP-specific services
- Enterprise compliance required

**Next Steps**:
1. Follow **WEEK1_CHECKLIST.md** starting Monday
2. Build features from **BUILD_PLAN_UPDATED.md**
3. Re-assess in 3 months

---

### **Option B: Migrate to GCP** 🔵 (Not Urgent)

**Why?**
- More control over infrastructure
- Pay-per-use pricing (good at scale)
- Access to GCP services (Pub/Sub, AI Platform, etc.)
- Prepare for enterprise customers

**Time Required**: 1-2 weeks (disrupts feature development)

**Cost**: $40-70/month (higher than current)

**When to do it?**
- Q1 2025 if growth demands it
- When Vercel limitations are hit
- If enterprise customers require it

**Next Steps** (if choosing this):
1. Week 1: Set up GCP infrastructure
2. Week 2: Migrate database and deploy
3. Week 3: Monitor and optimize
4. Reference **DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md** for steps
