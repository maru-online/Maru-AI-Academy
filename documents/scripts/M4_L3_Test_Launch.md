"You built your automation. It works on your laptop.
Now comes the scary part: Letting it loose in the wild.
Before you flip the switch, you need to run a **Dry Run** and check the **Edge Cases**."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: Edge Cases (0:40 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Slide: "What if..." list.
**Audio**: 
"Ask yourself:
What if the input is blank?
What if the data source is down?
What if the AI hallucinates?
Test these scenarios manually.
If your automation handles errors gracefully, you are ready to launch."
