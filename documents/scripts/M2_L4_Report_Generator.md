## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:40
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Executives don't read. They scan.
If you send a 10-page dense report to your boss, they will put it in the 'Read Later' pile... which means 'Read Never'.
To get decisions made, you need to write **Executive Summaries**.
AI excels at this. It can take 50 pages of messy notes and turn them into a clear, decision-ready 1-pager."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The SCAR Framework (0:40 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Slide: S-C-A-R. Situation, Complication, Action, Result.

**Audio**: 
"We use the SCAR format.
**S**ituation (What is happening?)
**C**omplication (What is the problem?)
**A**ction (What should we do?)
**R**esult (What will the outcome be?)
Let's see it in action."

## 🔍 3. Live Demo: Report Synthesis (2:00 - 2:40)
**Visual**: Screen Share. Pasting a long text.

**Audio**: 
"I'm pasting in these messy meeting notes about our vendor selection. It's chaotic.
Prompt: *'Act as a Business Analyst. Read these notes. Write a decision memo for the CEO using the SCAR format. Situation: We need a new vendor. Complication: Budget is tight. Action: Recommend Vendor B. Result: 20% savings. Keep it under 1 page.'*
Boom.
It cuts the fluff. It highlights the numbers. It puts the recommendation right at the top.
This is how you get your projects approved."
