**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"There are 10,000 AI tools out there.
How do you pick the right one?
Most people pick the one with the coolest demo video. That is a mistake.
I use the **PRICE** Framework to evaluate tools.
If a tool doesn't pass this test, I don't buy it."

"**P - Problem**: Does it solve a real pain I have daily?
**R - Reliability**: Is it buggy? (Check reviews).
**I - Integration**: Does it talk to my other tools?
**C - Cost**: is the ROI clear?

Always start with P: The Problem. Never start with the Tool."
