## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Hi. In Module 1, you wrote your first prompts. That's great.
But if you are writing a fresh prompt from scratch every single time you need an email... you are doing it wrong.
That is the rookie way.
The *Pro* way is **Template Thinking**.
Today I'm going to show you how to turn your best prompts into reusable assets that you—and your whole team—can use forever.
It's the difference between being a craftsman and running a factory."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Anatomy of a Template (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Slide showing "Fixed vs Variable".

**Audio**: 
"A normal prompt is rigid: *'Write an email to John about the budget.'*
A Template is flexible.
It has **Fixed Parts** (the instructions that never change) and **Variable Parts** (the specific details).
We use **[Square Brackets]** to mark the variables.
So it becomes: *'Write a [TONE] email to [RECIPIENT] about [TOPIC].'*
Now, you don't have to think about the prompt. You just fill in the blanks."

## 🔍 3. Live Demo: creating a Template (2:00 - 2:45)
**Visual**: Text Editor.

**Audio**: 
"Let's build one.
Say you often have to decline sales meetings politely.
Instead of typing 'No thanks' every time, let's build a template.
Prompt: *'Act as a busy executive. Write a polite decline to [SALESPERSON NAME] who wants to sell [PRODUCT]. Explain that we are [REASON FOR DECLINE], but keep the door open for [FUTURE DATE].'*
Now, whenever a salesperson emails you, you just paste this in, fill the brackets, and hit generate.
You just saved 5 minutes of mental energy."

**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Your challenge below is simple.
Take a task you do every day, and build a Template with at least 3 variables.
Once you start thinking in templates, you'll never go back."
