"Creating a slide deck is usually a nightmare.
You open PowerPoint, stare at a white rectangle, and wonder 'What goes on slide 1?'
That is the wrong way to work.
You shouldn't be designing slides until you have a Story.
Today I'm going to show you how to use AI to build the **Structure** of your presentation first, so the slides effectively design themselves."

Don't open PowerPoint yet. Open your AI.
Prompt: *'I need to pitch a new office layout to the CEO. Create a 5-slide outline. Slide 1: The Problem (Noise). Slide 2: The Solution (Hybrid Zones). Slide 3: The Benefits (Productivity). Slide 4: The Cost. Slide 5: Next Steps. For each slide, give me the Headline, 3 Bullet points, and Speaker Notes.'*
Look at that. It's not just giving you text; it's giving you the flow of the argument."
