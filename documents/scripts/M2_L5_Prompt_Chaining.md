# Video Script: Module 2, Lesson 5 - Prompt Chaining
**Target Length**: 3-4 minutes
**Tone**: Advanced, methodical, "Coding without Clode".

## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Sometimes, one prompt isn't enough.
If you ask AI to 'Write a best-selling novel' in one go, it will fail.
Complex tasks need to be broken down.
This is called **Prompt Chaining**.
It sounds technical, but it’s just logic: Step 1 leads to Step 2, which leads to Step 3.
It’s how we move from 'Chatting' to 'Engineering'."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The 3-Step Chain (0:45 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Screen Share. Simple flowchart or just doing it in Chat.

**Audio**: 
"Let's write a high-quality blog post.
**Step 1: Ideation.**
*'Generate 5 headline ideas for an article about Remote Work Productivity.'*
(Pick the best one).

**Step 2: Outlining.**
*'Using headline #3, write a detailed outline with H2 subheadings and bullet points for each section.'*
(Review and tweak the outline).

**Step 3: Drafting.**
*' Great. Now write the full article based on that outline. Use a professional tone.'*

**Step 4: Distributing.**
*'Now write a LinkedIn post and a Twitter thread to promote this article.'*

By chaining these steps, the AI stays focused. If you did this all in one prompt, it would hallucinate or get confused."

## 🔍 3. Live Demo: Result Comparison (2:30 - 3:15)
**Visual**: Showing the high-quality long-form result vs a short generic result.

**Audio**: 
"Compare this deep, structured article to what happens if just ask 'Write a blog about remote work'.
The chained version has structure, flow, and nuance.
The single-shot version is generic fluff.
Chaining allows you to be the **Architect**, checking the quality at every floor as the building goes up."

## 👉 4. Outro (Face to Camera) - 3:15 - 3:30
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"You have now engaged 'God Mode' on these tools.
You can break down any complex problem—contract review, strategy planning, coding—into a chain.
In the final challenge of this module, I want you to design your own 3-step chain.
Good luck, and congratulations on completing the Beginner Stream!"
