"We spend about 28% of our work week on email. That's insane.
Most of that time is spent worrying: 'Is this too aggressive?' 'Is this clear enough?'
AI is the ultimate cure for 'Email Anxiety'.
In this lesson, I'm giving you the **Maru Email Library**—5 templates that cover 90% of your inbox interactions.
The Polite Decline, The Status Update, The Meeting Request, The Feedback Response, and The Intro."

## 🖥️ 2. Live Demo: The Difficult Reply (0:30 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Screen Share.

**Audio**: 
"Let's look at the hardest one: **The Angry Customer Reply**.
You received a nasty email. Your blood pressure is up. Don't reply yet.
Paste their email into your AI and use this template:
*'Act as a Customer Success Manager. Read this angry email: [PASTE EMAIL]. Draft a response that 1) Acknowledges their frustration validates their feelings, 2) Explains that [ROOT CAUSE], and 3) Offers [SOLUTION]. Tone: Empathetic but professional. No defensive language.'*
Watch what happens. It strips out the emotion and gives you a perfect, de-escalating reply."

In 10 seconds, you have a report that looks like you spent an hour organizing it."
