## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera)
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen. Friendly & Direct.

**Audio**: 
"Hi, I'm Jimmy. Welcome to the Maru AI Academy.
If you’ve watched sci-fi movies, you might think AI is this magic robot brain that can do anything—or maybe take your job.
But let’s cut through the hype. 
In this first lesson, I want to show you what modern AI *actually* is, and why it’s about to become the most powerful productivity tool in your toolkit.
Let’s dive in."

## 🧠 2. The Concept: Pattern Matching (0:20 - 1:00)
**Visual**: Animation of a person reading a library of books. Then show a phone keyboard "predicting" the next word.

**Audio**: 
"At its core, tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are Large Language Models (LLMs).
Think of them as 'Autocomplete on Steroids'.
They have read billions of documents—books, websites, articles—and learned the *patterns* of human language.
When you ask a question, it’s not 'thinking' like a human. It’s calculating, with incredible accuracy, which word comes next."

## 💡 3. The Metaphor: The Brilliant Intern (1:00 - 1:45)
**Visual**: Split screen. Left side: A stressed expert. Right side: An eager intern with a stack of files.

**Audio**: 
"The best way to think about AI today is like hiring a **Brilliant, but Junior, Intern**.
They have read every book in the library (they’re smart).
But they don’t know your specific business context (they’re junior).
If you give them a vague instruction like 'Do the report', they will fail.
But if you give them clear instructions, context, and examples, they will produce work in seconds that would take you hours."

## 🚀 4. Practical Takeaway (1:45 - 2:15)
**Visual**: Screen recording showing a simple prompt input and output. Text overlay: "Garbage In = Garbage Out".

**Audio**: 
"This brings us to the golden rule of AI: **Quality of Input determines Quality of Output.**
If you treat it like a magic search engine, you’ll get generic, boring answers.
If you treat it like a collaborative partner and guide it, you’ll get gold.
We call this skill **Prompt Engineering**, and that is exactly what you are going to master in this course."

## 👉 5. Outro (Face to Camera)
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Audio**: 
"So, don't worry about the robots taking over yet.
Focus on learning the patterns.
In the next step below, I want you to write your very first professional prompt using the playground.
Give it a try, and I'll see you in the next lesson."
