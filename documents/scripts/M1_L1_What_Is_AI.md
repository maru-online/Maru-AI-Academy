# Video Script: Module 1, Lesson 1 - What AI Actually Is
**Target Length**: 2-3 minutes
**Tone**: Professional, demystifying, encouraging.

## 🎬 1. Intro (0:00 - 0:20)
**Visual**: Host (Jimmy or Avatar) on screen. Dynamic text overlay: "Magic vs. Math".

**Audio**: 
"Welcome to the Maru AI Academy. 
If you’ve watched sci-fi movies, you might think AI is a magic robot brain that can do anything.
Or maybe you’re worried it’s going to take your job.
Let’s cut through the hype. Today, we’re going to learn what modern AI *actually* is, and why it’s the most powerful productivity tool you’ve ever had access to."

## 🧠 2. The Concept: Pattern Matching (0:20 - 1:00)
**Visual**: Animation of a person reading a library of books. Then show a phone keyboard "predicting" the next word.

**Audio**: 
"At its core, tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are Large Language Models (LLMs).
Think of them as 'Autocomplete on Steroids'.
They have read billions of documents—books, websites, articles—and learned the *patterns* of human language.
When you ask a question, it’s not 'thinking' like a human. It’s calculating, with incredible accuracy, which word comes next."

## 💡 3. The Metaphor: The Brilliant Intern (1:00 - 1:45)
**Visual**: Split screen. Left side: A stressed expert. Right side: An eager intern with a stack of files.

**Audio**: 
"The best way to think about AI today is like hiring a **Brilliant, but Junior, Intern**.
They have read every book in the library (they’re smart).
But they don’t know your specific business context (they’re junior).
If you give them a vague instruction like 'Do the report', they will fail.
But if you give them clear instructions, context, and examples, they will produce work in seconds that would take you hours."

## 🚀 4. Practical Takeaway (1:45 - 2:15)
**Visual**: Screen recording showing a simple prompt input and output. Text overlay: "Garbage In = Garbage Out".

**Audio**: 
"This brings us to the golden rule of AI: **Quality of Input determines Quality of Output.**
If you treat it like a magic search engine, you’ll get generic, boring answers.
If you treat it like a collaborative partner and guide it, you’ll get gold.
We call this skill **Prompt Engineering**, and that is exactly what you are going to master in this course."

## 👉 5. Outro & Call to Action (2:15 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Host returns. Text: "Next Step: Your First Prompt".

**Audio**: 
"So, stop worrying about the robot apocalypse.
Let’s start building your new superpower.
In the next step, you’re going to write your very first professional prompt.
Click 'Continute' and let’s dive in."
