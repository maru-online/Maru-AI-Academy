"Welcome to the Capstone Module.
You are going to build a real, working AI automation.
The biggest mistake students make is picking a project that is too big.
'I want to automate my entire accounting department.' No. You will fail.
We need to pick a project that is **Boring** and **Frequent**."

"Use the FRS Filter.
**Frequency**: Does it happen every day? (If yes, good).
**Repeatability**: Is it the same steps every time? (If yes, good).
**Safety**: If it breaks, does the company explode? (If yes, bad).
We want High Frequency, High Repeatability, Low Risk.
Like 'Summarizing daily meeting notes'."
