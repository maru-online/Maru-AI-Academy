## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:30
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Hi there.
One of the biggest reasons people get overwhelmed by AI is simply *choice paralysis*.
There are thousands of tools launching every week.
ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Midjourney, Jasper... it’s a lot.
In this lesson, I’m going to simplify the entire landscape into just **Four Categories**.
Once you understand these four buckets, you’ll know exactly which tool to grab for any job."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The 4 Categories (0:30 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Screen Share of a slide/diagram showing 4 quadrants or columns.

**Audio**: 
"Here is your mental map for the AI world.

**Category 1: Text & Analysis (The 'Brain')**
This is ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Use these for writing emails, summarizing reports, brainstorming ideas, or coding. If it involves words or logic, start here.

**Category 2: Image & Visuals (The 'Artist')**
This is Midjourney, DALL-E, or Canva Magic. Use these when you need a slide background, a social media post, or a mockup. They don't 'read' text well, but they 'draw' beautifully.

**Category 3: Audio & Video (The 'Studio')**
Tools like ElevenLabs (for voice) or HeyGen (for avatars). They turn text into multimedia. Great for content creation, but not for daily office admin.

**Category 4: Automation (The 'Glue')**
This is where it gets powerful. Tools like Zapier or Make. They connect the 'Brain' to your email or Slack. We'll cover this in the Intermediate course."

## 🔍 3. Live Demo: Choosing the Right Tool (2:00 - 2:45)
**Visual**: Show ChatGPT interface, then flip to Midjourney Discord (or Canva).

**Audio**: 
"Let’s say you need to launch a new product.
You’d go to **ChatGPT** (Category 1) to write the press release.
Then, you’d go to **Canva** (Category 2) to design the flyer.
Don't try to get ChatGPT to draw the flyer—it's not built for that.
Using the right tool for the job is 90% of the battle."
