# 🎥 Maru Academy Video Style Guide
**Reference**: [freeCodeCamp Style](https://freecodecamp.com)
**Format**: Personal Expert Guide (Jimmy) + High-Clarity Screen Share

## 🎨 Core Principles
1.  **Authenticity > Polish**: It's better to be real and enthusiastic than perfectly robotic. Minor stumbles are okay if the energy is good.
2.  **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Limit "Talking Head" time to Intro/Outro. Spend 80% of the video showing the tool, the prompt, or the diagram.
3.  **Respect Time**: No 2-minute energetic YouTube intros. Start teaching within 15 seconds.

## 📐 Video Structure Template

### 1. The "Hook" (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:30
*   **Visual**: You, full screen, good lighting.
*   **Script**: "Hi, I'm Jimmy. In this lesson, we're going to learn [X] so you can [Y]."
*   **Goal**: Establish connection and relevance.

### 2. The "Meat" (Screen Share + Voiceover) - 0:30 to End
*   **Visual**: Clean screen recording (1080p).
    *   **Zoom In**: 125-150% zoom on browser/interfaces. text must be readable on mobile.
    *   **Mouse**: Smooth movements.
*   **Audio**: Your voiceover (recorded while doing it, or dubbed).
*   **Content**:
    *   Step 1: The Concept (Diagram/Slide)
    *   Step 2: The Action (Live Demo)
    *   Step 3: The Result

### 3. The "Outro" (Face to Camera) - Final 15s
*   **Visual**: You, full screen.
*   **Script**: "Give that a try in the playground below. See you in the next lesson."

## 🛠️ Technical Setup (Recommended)
*   **Software**: Loom (easiest), OBS (free, pro), or Screen Studio (Mac, beautiful zooms).
*   **Audio**: dedicated mic (even a USB lapel mic is better than laptop mic).
*   **Lighting**: Face window or simple ring light.
